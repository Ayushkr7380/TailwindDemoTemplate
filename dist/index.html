            <p><span class="font-semibold text-xl">His saga is the enterpreneurial creation myth </span>: Steve Jobs confounded Apple in his parent's garage in 1976, was ousted in 1985, returned to rescue it from near bankruptcy in 1997, and by the time he died, in October 2011, has built it into the world's most valuable company.
            Along the way he helped to transform seven industries: Personal computing, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, retail stores, and digital publishing. He thus belongs in the pantheon of America's great innovators, along with Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, adn Walt Disney. None of these men was a saint, but after theri personalities are forgotten, history will remember how they applied imagination to technology and business.</p>

But they don't" Then he paused for a few moments and said, almost wistfullt,"And we got some amazing things done." Indeed,he and Apple had a string of hits over the past dozen years that was greater than that of any other innovative company in modern times: iMax, iPod, iPod nano, iTunes Store, Apple Stores, MacBook, iPhone , iPad ,App Store ,OS X Lion---not to mention every pixar film, And as he battled his finaly illness, Jobs was sorrounded by an intensely loyal cadre of colleagues who had been inspired by him for years and a very loving wife, sister, and four children.</p>
